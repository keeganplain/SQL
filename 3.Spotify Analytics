## For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
## Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
## Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

## Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

## Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

## What are the top five most popular songs in 2021?
  SELECT 
      artist_name,
      track_name,
      avg(popularity)
  FROM
      BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY 
      artist_name,
      track_name
  ORDER BY 
      avg(popularity) DESC
  LIMIT 5;


## What soungs are more likely to get you to dance?
  SELECT 
      id, 
      artist_name, 
      track_name, 
      danceability 
  FROM 
      BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY 
      artist_name,
      track_name
  ORDER BY 
      danceability DESC
  LIMIT 5;


## How does danceability of the song influence its popularity?
  SELECT 
      id, 
      artist_name, 
      track_name, 
      danceability,
      popularity
  FROM 
      BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY 
      artist_name,
      track_name
  ORDER BY
      danceability DESC
  LIMIT 5;

## What are the best key and modality for a song to be "popular"?
  SELECT 
      id, 
      artist_name, 
      track_name, 
      song_key, 
      song_mode,
      popularity
  FROM 
      BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY 
      artist_name,
      track_name
  ORDER BY 
      popularity DESC
  LIMIT 5;

## Which artists has the most songs on Spotifys top 50 chart?
  SELECT 
      artist_name, 
      COUNT(artist_name) AS quantity
  FROM 
      BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY 
      artist_name
  ORDER BY 
      quantity DESC
  LIMIT 2;
